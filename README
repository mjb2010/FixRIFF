FixRIFF README
==============

FixRIFF was written to solve a problem where some 16-bit, 44.1 kHz PCM-containing
WAV files had undercounted ChunkSize and SubChunkSize values.

Software reading such WAVs will typically honor the stated values, discarding
any data at the end of the file, truncating incomplete samples if necessary.
Generally this is good, because the software shouldn't treat extra data
(e.g. ID3 tags) as if they were audio data. However, it's bad if the values are
simply wrong, and you really do have valid audio data beyond where the chunks
supposedly end.

All FixRIFF does, at this point, is checks all the WAV files in the current folder,
not counting any whose names end with "-fixed.wav", to see if the master ChunkSize
at the beginning of the RIFF header and the data SubChunkSize at the end of the
header look OK. If either seems to be wrong, they'll be fixed. The fixed version of
the file is written to a new file with a "-fixed.wav" suffix.

Obviously this could go horribly wrong. It's operating under the assumption that
the RIFF header is 44 bytes long, and that everything in the file after that is
valid audio data. So if that's not true, then you're going to screw up your WAVs.
Make a backup before trusting this program to do what you want!
